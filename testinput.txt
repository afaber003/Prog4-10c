now listen up here's a story
about a little guy in a blue world,
and all day, and all night, everything he sees
is just blue like him,
inside and outside

blue his house with a bluw little window and a blue
corvette and everything is blue for him and himself
and all the people around, cause he ain't got somebody
to listen... listen... listen...
